## Ingredients

- Onions
- Add ham and cook a bit
- 1-2 cans of cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup depending on how saucy you like your casserole
- Worcestershire Sauce
- cheese
- soup mix
- tater tots

## Instructions

1. Chop and saute onions, then add the ham and soup
1. Most recipes say to add ketchup, but they are wrong. Pour in Worcestershire until it starts to get a bit uncomfortable. Doubling the amount in the recipe is for the timid.
1. Layer tots in a casserole dish (I just dump them into a layer)
1. pour soup mix on top
1. "Sprinkle" (read: pour) a layer of cheese
1. Cover with another layer of tots
1. Cook 400 for 45 mins or so (It's really too hard to burn this)
1. Sprink cheese on top and Broil till crisps (it's very easy to burn this)
