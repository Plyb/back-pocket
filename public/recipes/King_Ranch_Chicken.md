# King Ranch Chicken

The second recipe, King Ranch Chicken, is AMAZING. I found the recipe and absolutely love it. It re-heats super well as leftovers too.


## Ingredients

- ½ cup onion, diced
- ½ cup green bell pepper, diced
- 4 cups cooked and shredded chicken (Pick up a rotisserie chicken and tear it apart)
- 1 (10.5 oz) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, not diluted
- 1 (10.5 oz) can condensed cream of chicken soup not diluted
- 1 (10oz) can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (I use Mild Rotel and it’s not spicy)
- 14 corn tortillas torn into 1-inch pieces
- 3 and ¼ cups shredded cheddar cheese


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
2. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly with melted butter.
3. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, sauté onion and green pepper until tender
4. (4 to 5 minutes). Turn off heat.
5. To the skillet, add the shredded cooked chicken, both cans of soup (undiluted) and the canned tomatoes. Stir well to combine.
6. Arrange 1/3 of the corn tortillas in an even layer in the bottom of prepared casserole dish, followed by 1/3 of the chicken mixture and 1/3 of the shredded cheddar cheese
7. Repeat with two more layers, finishing with the shredded cheddar
8. Bake in 375°F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until heated through and bubbly
