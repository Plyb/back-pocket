# Zach’s Apple Curry


## Ingredients

- I usually do potato, carrot, onion, bell pepper, choice of meet (usually chicken but beef goes hard too), and then obviously apples. You gotta get a Japanese curry packet. Golden curry is pretty good. Use one square of the solid curry per person you want to feed. And then decided the amount of each ingredient you want per serving and do the math.


## Instructions

1. I usually start with Steaming/boiling the potatoes and carrots after I have cut them up bc they take the longest to cook. Then I remove them from the pan and do the onion, meat, and bell pepper. Then once everything is cooked I add the potatoes and carrots back in and then also add the curry cubes. You will need to add water to help the cubes dissolve/ just make the curry itself, but I go as light as I think I can on the water and then add slowly so I don’t thin it out too fast. After it’s a good consistency I’ll take it off the heat and then add the apples. That way they keep their crunch
