# Crispy Parmesan Chicken with Garlic Herb Couscous & Lemony Roasted Carrots

Consider plain chicken breasts a thing of the past: in this recipe, the white meat gets gussied up in a gorgeous golden breadcrumb topping with paprika and Parmesan cheese. You’ll roast it and the lemony carrots on the same sheet—once they’re in the oven, the only thing left to do is boil the couscous and toss in the garlic herb butter. Simple, satisfying, and supercharged with flavor—what more could you ask for?

Servings: 2  
Total: 40min  


## Ingredients

- 12 ounce Carrots
- 2 unit Scallions
- 1 unit Lemon
- ¼ cup Panko Breadcrumbs
- ¼ cup Parmesan Cheese
- 1 teaspoon Hot Smoked Paprika
- 10 ounce Chicken Cutlets
- 2 tablespoon Sour Cream
- ½ cup Israeli Couscous
- 2 tablespoon Garlic Herb Butter
- 4 teaspoon Olive Oil
- Salt
- Pepper


## Instructions

1. Adjust rack to middle position (middle and top positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry all produce. Trim, peel, and halve carrots; cut crosswise into 2-inch-thick pieces. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens. Zest and quarter lemon.
2. In a small bowl, combine panko, Parmesan, paprika, a large drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper. Place on one side of a baking sheet (for 4 servings, spread out across entire sheet). Spread tops of chicken with sour cream. Mound with panko mixture, pressing to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).
3. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4 servings, toss carrots on a second sheet.) Roast on middle rack until chicken is cooked through and carrots are browned and tender, 15-20 minutes. (For 4, roast chicken on middle rack and carrots on top rack.) Transfer chicken to a plate to rest. TIP: If carrots are done before chicken, remove from sheet and continue roasting chicken.
4. Meanwhile, add couscous to pot of boiling water. Cook until tender, 6-8 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Melt garlic herb butter in empty pot over medium heat. Add scallion whites and cook until softened, 1 minute. Return couscous to pot and stir until coated. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat.
5. Once carrots are done roasting, remove from oven and toss with lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice to taste.
6. Divide chicken, carrots, and couscous between plates. Garnish chicken with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lemon wedges on the side.
