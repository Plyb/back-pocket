# Chicken Alfredo Casserole

The casserole recipe is super easy to slap together. We’ve done it with half italian blend cheese and half mozzarella and haven’t really tasted a difference between the two, so don’t worry too much about which cheese to use.

Servings: 8  


## Ingredients

- 1 box (16 oz) penne pasta
- 2 jars (15 oz each) alfredo sauce
- 3 cups (24 oz) chicken stock or chicken broth
- 2 cups cooked shredded chicken
- 2 cups chopped fresh broccoli
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 cups shredded Italian blend cheese or shredded mozzarella cheese


## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Spray a 9×13 casserole dish with cooking spray.
2. Add all the ingredients (not the cheese) into the casserole dish and stir it until it’s well mixed. Cover the baking dish with tin foil.
3. Bake for 35-45 minutes or until the pasta reaches your preferred texture. Uncover the baking dish halfway through the bake time and give it a good stir, and then put the tin foil back on and continue cooking it.
4. * For al dente pasta, cook for about 35 minutes. For softer pasta, cook for 45 minutes.
5. Remove the casserole from the oven and sprinkle the cheese over top. Place it back into the oven, under the broiler, for a few minutes until the cheese has melted and started to turn light golden brown.
6. Let set for about 5 minutes before serving it warm.


## Notes

Broccoli: I recommend only using fresh broccoli. One head of broccoli will make enough for the 2 cups of chopped broccoli the recipe calls for. Chop the broccoli into small florets. If you use frozen broccoli, you may want to thaw it before using so it does not drain off as much water when it’s thawing and cooking inside the casserole.
Alfredo Sauce: Use a good tasting, quality alfredo sauce for this recipe. The taste really shines through so make sure you like it. I love the Bertolli brand or Rao’s brand.
 - I normally use Bertolli: 1 jar alfredo sauce + 1 jar of roasted garlic alfredo sauce.
Seasonings: Use less or more of each seasoning. You can also add more seasonings such as dried basil, dried parsley, or some red pepper chili flakes for some spice.
Salt & Chicken Broth or Stock: Chicken stock usually is saltier than broth (in my opinion) so I recommend using 3/4 teaspoon of kosher salt if using chicken stock. I always use full salted broth or stock plus the kosher salt that’s called for in the recipe. But again, maybe try making the recipe as is and see how you like it and then make changes with the salt content. My kids love the recipe as is but I would prefer 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt instead of 1 teaspoon.
