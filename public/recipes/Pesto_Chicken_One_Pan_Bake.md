## Ingredients

- 750 g New potatoes
- 2 tbsp Olive oil

- Salt and pepper


## Instructions

1. Pre heat the oven to 200C.
2. Put the potatoes and olive oil into the pan, toss the potatoes until coated and bake for about 30 minutes, until starting to soften.
3. Add the chicken fillets and then spoon the pesto on top of the potatoes and chicken. Put back into the oven for 10 minutes.

## Notes

Chicken
I used Mini Fillets here as they are an easy size to cook and coat in the sauce (and fit in the pan!) but any cut of chicken would work, you'll just need to adjust the cooking time accordingly and of course, always check that the meat is cooked before serving.
Pesto
You can use your favourite green pesto jar of choice, or you can make your own homemade pesto. You can get gluten free pesto too, if that's for you.
