## Ingredients

- 300g passata
- 4 plain naans
- 210g pack mozzarella, drained and roughly torn
- 100g grated mature Cheddar
- 1 red onion, finely sliced
- 60g pitted green olives, sliced
- 1 ½ tbsp olive oil
- 1 lemon, zested and juiced
- 125g baby spinach
- ½ cucumber, roughly chopped
- 10g fresh basil, leaves picked


## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Put 2 large baking trays in the oven to heat up.
2. Spread the passata over the top of each naan, leaving a 1cm border. Top each with mozzarella, Cheddar, onion and olives, then season with black pepper. Transfer to the hot trays and bake for 12-15 mins until the cheese has melted and the naans are golden and crisp.
3. Meanwhile, whisk together the oil, half the lemon juice, a little lemon zest and some seasoning in a salad bowl to make a dressing. Add the spinach and cucumber and toss well to coat. Add more lemon juice, to taste, if needed. Top the naan with the basil leaves and serve with the salad.
