# Potato Breakfast Skillet | Student Breakfast Series


## Ingredients

- 0.5 onion
- 75 grams bacon
- 2 padron peppers
- 2 eggs
- sage to taste
- 1 scallion
- salt to taste
- black pepper to taste
- shredded cheese to taste


## Instructions

1. Prepare your ingredients: dice your onions and potatoes, and slice your peppers.
2. Cook the bacon starting from a cold pan until crispy and the fat has been rendered out. Remove the bacon and place it on a paper towel.
3. Add your onion on medium heat and sweat it for a few seconds until it gets soft.
4. Add your potatoes and simply cook them on medium heat, flipping from time to time to make sure everything gets cooked and nothing gets burnt. Also, add your sliced peppers in the middle of this process.
5. When the potatoes are cooked, season with salt and pepper, and add your bacon back. Optionally, but highly recommended, you can add some chopped sage at this stage.
6. Create 2 spaces in your potatoes for your eggs. Crack the eggs, making sure not to break the yolks. Season them, top everything with cheese, and cover with a lid for a few minutes until the eggs are cooked to your desired state.
7. Top with fresh spring onion and enjoy!
