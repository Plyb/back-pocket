## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small white onion, peeled and diced
- 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas (a.k.a. garbanzo beans),rinsed and drained
- 1 (15-ounce) can fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, to taste
- Kosher salt and black pepper, to taste
- 3 cups roughly-chopped kale leaves or baby spinach
- chopped fresh cilantro and fresh lemon wedges, for serving


## Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onion and carrot and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and translucent. (To save time, mince the garlic while the onion is cooking.) Then add garlic and saute for 1 more minute, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Add in the vegetable stock, chickpeas, tomatoes, tomato paste, cumin, cinnamon, and red pepper flakes, and bring to a simmer. (While the soup is coming to a simmer, chop the kale and cilantro, and slice the lemon wedges.)
2. Reduce heat to medium-low, and stir in the chopped kale. Continue simmering for 3 minutes until the kale has slightly softened.
3. Taste and season with your desired amount of salt and pepper. (I used a generous pinch of each.)
4. Serve warm, garnished with fresh cilantro and served with a fresh lemon wedge.


## Notes

This recipe can also easily be made in the slow cooker! Just add all of the ingredients minus the kale to a large crock-pot and cook on low for 6-8 hours, or on high for 3-4 hours. Then once you’re ready to serve, stir in the kale and let it rest for about 3 minutes. And serve warm, garnished with fresh cilantro and served with a fresh lemon wedge.
