# Beef Flautas Supreme with Pico de Gallo & Lime Crema

Don’t get us wrong, we love a traditional taco—but when we’re in the mood to mix things up, we love flautas, aka rolled-up tacos with a crispy outer shell. Here, we achieve the signature flauta crunch factor by baking the stuffed tortillas (full of zesty beef and Mexican cheese) for perfectly golden results—no messy deep-frying required. That crispy crust is the perfect canvas for some of our favorite toppings: pico de gallo and lime crema. Yes, you really can have it all.

Servings: 2  
Total: 30min  


## Ingredients

- 1 unit Yellow Onion
- 10 ounce Ground Beef
- 1 unit Tex-Mex Paste (see https://mysweetprecision.com/tex-mex-paste/#:~:text=The%20main%20ingredient%20in%20tex,powder%2C%20and%20other%20natural%20flavors. for rough proportions)
- 1 tablespoon Southwest Spice Blend (garlic powder, cumin, chili powder 2:1:1)
- 6 unit Flour Tortillas
- ½ cup Mexican Cheese Blend
- 1 unit Lime
- 1 unit Roma Tomato
- 4 tablespoon Sour Cream
- 2 teaspoon Cooking Oil
- 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
- Salt


## Instructions

1. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and brush with oil or coat with nonstick spray. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion; mince a few slices until you have 1 TBSP (2 TBSP for 4 servings).
3. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion; cook for 3 minutes.
4. Add beef* and Southwest Spice; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and onion is softened, 4-6 minutes.
5. Stir in Tex-Mex paste and 1⁄3 cup water (½ cup for 4 servings). Simmer until mixture is thickened and beef is cooked through, 2-4 minutes more. Turn off heat.
6. Meanwhile, drizzle tortillas with 1 TBSP olive oil (2 TBSP for 4 servings); brush or rub to completely coat.
7. Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Once beef filling is done, add a heaping ¼ cup filling to one side of each tortilla, then sprinkle each with 1 TBSP Mexican cheese. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to create flautas. Place seam sides down on prepared sheet. TIP: Make sure the flautas are snug on the sheet—this will prevent them from unrolling.
8. Bake on middle rack until golden brown and crispy, 8-12 minutes.
9. While flautas bake, finely dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion,
10. half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt.
11. In a separate small bowl, combine sour cream, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.
12. Divide flautas between plates. Top with pico de gallo and lime crema. Serve.
